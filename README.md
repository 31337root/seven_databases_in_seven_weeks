# seven_databases_in_seven_weeks

"Choosing a database is perhaps one of the most important architectural 
decisions a developer can make. Seven databases in seven weeks provides
a fantastic tour of different technologies and makes it easy to add each
to your engineering toolbox." - Dave Parfitt

"By comparing each database technology to a tool you'd find in any workshop,
the authors of seven databases in seven weeks provide a practical and 
well-balanced survey of a very diverse and highly varied datastore landscape.
Anyone looking to get a handle on the database options available to them
as a data platform should read this book and consider the trade-offs presented
for each option." - Matthew Oldham
